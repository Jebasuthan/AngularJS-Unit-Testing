1. npm init (package.json will create)
2. Configure the package.json
3. npm install karma --save-dev
4. npm install karma-cli -g
5. npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev
6. karma init
7. We have to configure the karma.conf.js
8. karma start karma.conf.js
8. npm i karma-jasmine-html-reporter --save-dev(for reporter in browser)
9. We have to update the reporters as (reporters: ['html'])
10. npm i karma-coverage --save-dev (for codecoverage)
11. We have to update the coverage settings in karma.conf.js
12. preprocessors: {
	// have to add the code coverage files
    },
    

Example:
    preprocessors: {
        'controller/*.js' : ['coverage']
    },

and we have to update reporters: ['html'] as --->
   
    reporters: ['html', 'coverage'],

13. Code coverage will create only on PhantomJS mode. So we have to set as
	browsers: ['PhantomJS'],

14. karma start karma.conf.js
